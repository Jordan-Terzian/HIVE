Dear Diary - Dev Chopra (z5363081)

Week 1:

In our week 1 lab meeting, we set out tasks for each team member. 
We split out the backend and frontend workloads and agreed to use Django on the backend
and React on the frontend as frameworks. We also decided to use MongoDB for our database
and host everything on Azure.

Myself and Joe were responsible for the system architecture diagram and Joe started 
while we all further analyzed the spec.

Week 2:

In week 2, I built upon Joe's addition to the system architecture diagram as we finalized our proposal.
Myself and Jordan also sat down with the project coordinator Basem. Jordan organized this meeting and
I sat down with him while he ran this meeting. I asked further questions on branding requirements and
guidelines on future scalability for the app and the risks he wanted us to keep in mind. Next week
we finalize our proposal and submit it.

Week 3:

In week 3, we finalized the system architecture and then submitted the project proposal. I then started
working on the database schema for the backend which is now finalized and can be viewed at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PlMIwZAYaD8yGobWrlffseYvjzCunwAW/view?usp=sharing
Next week, I'll be initalizing the backend and beginning work on the database and creating the backend project for us to start 
writing our functionality.

Week 4:

I initialized the backend, wrote out the database schema in django and made the endpoints for login and register and got both student and tutor details. Next week I plan on writing out tests and working on tutor documents and profile pictures.
