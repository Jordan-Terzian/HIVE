COMP3900H11B Heads Project Diary - z5206674(Joe Jin)

Week 1:

During the first week, the roles of the different team members were decided, alongside

with the relevant frameworks to be used to build the frontend and backend, as well as the database.


Within the project proposal, Dev and I were tasked with the system architecture diagram component.

Week 2:

On the second week, I had started on the system architecture diagram as well as the relevant writeups 

which were then picked up and finished by Dev after we had gone through and expanded upon week 1 on 

how we were going to build the application.

Week 3:

This week was mainly spent on exploring the Django framework and implement authentication endpoints for the application.

Week 4:

Week 4 was just continuing on the work from week 3 with the authentication endpoints, with occational changes to the 

database structure, and/or the fields on forms, as well as checking things using the frontend platform.
