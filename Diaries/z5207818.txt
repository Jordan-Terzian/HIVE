COMP3900 - Chao Hong He Diary 

Week 1

During first meeting in lab, we delegated sections of the proposal report to different team members as follows

Background: Jordan Terzian 
User stories and sprints: Chao Hong He & Raf Hughes 
StoryBoards: Jordan Terzian 
System Architecture Diagram: Dev Chopra and Joe Jin 

Before the end of the week Raf and I went on own ways to complete the User Stories and Sprints separately so that
we can collate the information in our next meeting.

Week 2 

During week 2 I continued work on the User Stories and Sprints, and had a preliminary version completed by the thursday meeting.
Raf and I came together with our own findings and started putting the information into our shared proposal report document. The
section is in its preliminary completion. Coding section (front-end front matter) has been delegated and I have looked at how
to approach this.

Week 3

Finalising content in the User Stories section of the proposal with Raf. Final proposal formatting to present information clearly and succinctly. Started looking at approach to frontend of web platform.
